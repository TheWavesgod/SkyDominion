# Sky Dominion
## Introduction
**Sky Dominion** is a multiplayer online aerial combat game developed in Unreal Engine 5.3, supporting up to four players in combat. With just a Steam account, you can join forces with your friends, select a fighter jet, and engage in 1v1 or 2v2 team battles over a shared terrain.<br>

The primary motivation behind creating this game was for job-seeking purposes, to serve as part of my personal portfolio. The majority of the game's functionalities are implemented in C++, with the remainder completed using Blueprints. I chose this theme due to my interest in military action genres and my previous experience working at a military simulation company. This game was crafted based on my basic understanding of fighter jets.
